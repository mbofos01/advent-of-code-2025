# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 programming challenge.

## What is Advent of Code?
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of holiday-themed programming puzzles. Each day from December 1st to 25th, a new puzzle is released. Participants solve the puzzles in any language and share their solutions.

## Participation
- I am solving the puzzles daily in December 2025.
- Solutions are organized by day in the `challenges/` folder.
- Each day's folder contains my code and input files.

## How to Run
Navigate to the day's folder and run the corresponding Python script. Example:
```
cd challenges/day1
python main.py
```

Most scripts support a `--debug` flag to use the sample/demo input instead of the real puzzle input:
```
python main.py --debug
```
